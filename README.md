# AutoVoice
AutoVoice was a fantastic Discord bot to create, manage and delete voice channels - automatically.

Users would join a predefined voice channel, the socalled "auto channel". Then, the bot would create a new channel for them and move them into it. Once all participating members left the channel, it would be deleted automagically.

This bot kept Discord servers clean - kept... A fatal database error and data corruption rendered the entire database useless - so far, that I had to reset it. At that point I had other plans and the bot had not seen far adoption yet as I had not completely finished it to my satisfaction. I have decided to let it sit for now and possibly take on this project again in the future. RIP AutoVoice
